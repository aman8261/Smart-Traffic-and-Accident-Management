# AI-Based Intelligent Traffic Management System 🚦

An AI-driven traffic management system that uses real-time computer vision and deep learning to detect emergency vehicles, road accidents, and traffic density, enabling dynamic traffic signal control and faster emergency response.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional traffic signal systems operate on fixed timing and lack real-time adaptability. As a result:
- Emergency vehicles like ambulances get stuck in traffic
- Road accidents are not detected or reported instantly
- Manual traffic control is slow and inefficient
- Traffic congestion is poorly managed during peak hours

These limitations lead to delayed emergency response, increased accident risks, and inefficient traffic flow.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

This project proposes a **fully automated AI-based Intelligent Traffic Management System** that:
- Analyzes live or recorded traffic video feeds
- Detects emergency vehicles and road accidents in real time
- Estimates lane-wise traffic density
- Dynamically controls traffic signals using Arduino
- Automatically sends emergency alerts with GPS location to nearby hospitals

The system integrates **deep learning, computer vision, embedded hardware, and communication modules** to provide a scalable smart-city-ready solution.
